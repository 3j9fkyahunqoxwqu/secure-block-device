=== 2.3.2.2 ae.h ===

AEAD API 0.12 - 23-MAY-2012

This file gives an interface appropriate for many authenticated
encryption with associated data (AEAD) implementations. It does not try
to accommodate all possible options or limitations that an implementation
might have -- you should consult the documentation of your chosen
implementation to find things like RFC 5116 constants, alignment
requirements, whether the incremental interface is supported, etc.

This file is in the public domain. It is provided "as is", without
warranty of any kind. Use at your own risk.

Comments are welcome: Ted Krovetz <ted@krovetz>.
